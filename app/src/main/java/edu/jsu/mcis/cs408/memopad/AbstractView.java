     * it specifies an abstract method called "modelPropertyChange()", which
     * receives a PropertyChange event from a Controller and updates the View(s)
     * accordingly.  Each View object which implements this interface must
     * implement "modelPropertyChange()" in its own way, since each View may
     * render or handle the corresponding property of the Model differently.
